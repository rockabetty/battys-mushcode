# RockaBatty's MUSHCode Tomfoolery

The code uploaded here is written for PennMUSH!  It's intended for the less so code inclined to be able to copy paste into their clients.

# Usage / Installation
Currently, you need to already have a running version of PennMUSH and a PostgreSQL database running to connect to.  Copy the contents of `start_here.txt` into your MUSH client and let her rip.
